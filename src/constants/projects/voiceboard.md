**Winner of Google's Hack for Social Good Challenge** at Shell Hacks 2024! VoiceBoard AI makes **whiteboarding accessible to everyone** by converting speech into diagrams in real-time. We were able to send transcribed speech to a **Google Gemini** backend, which used the current state of the board and the users request to generate/modify diagrams using **Mermaid.js**.

Highlights:
• **Accessibility breakthrough** for users with motor disabilities
• **Speech-to-diagram conversion** using advanced NLP
• **Real-time diagram generation** with Mermaid.js
• **Google Gemini integration** for intelligent diagram interpretation
