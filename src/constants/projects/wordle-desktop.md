Wordle Desktop was my **first desktop application** built with Qt in C++. Created after being dissatisfied with CLI-only development, this project marked my transition to **GUI-based application development**.

Development journey:
• **First GUI application** using Qt and C++
• **Wordle game clone** with complete game mechanics
• **Qt Creator IDE** for modern C++ development
• **Cross-platform compatibility** through Qt framework

Technical learning:
• **Qt framework** for cross-platform GUI development
• **C++ programming** for desktop application development
• **Qt Creator IDE** for efficient development workflow
• **Event-driven programming** for interactive user interfaces
