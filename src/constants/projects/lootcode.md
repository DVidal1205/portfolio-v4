Lootcode is what I consider to be my first **real** project. I have worked on a handful in the past, but none have gotten me as excited, dedicated, and passionate as this one. Lootcode was a shared vision of myself, Leonard Gofman, and Luke Cullen. We teamed up to build Lootcode for the **Knight Hacks Projects Program** in 2023, which we won!

I wanted to make another fantasy/TTRPG themed project, Leonard wanted to experiment with code-grade servers after getting into ICPC, and Luke wanted to do something gamified. Lootcode started as a pun based off the DSA platform **Leetcode**, and we ran with it. And it worked! We were actually able to create a secure, isolated code grade server using **Docker** and **Zx Shell** that supports **7 programming languages** - C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Rust, and Go

Embark on an **82 problem** journey through **Algorion**, a narratively rich world in ruin - that only you can save. We received recognition for Lootcode by the **Linux Magazine for Free and Open Source Software** which was a huge honor for us. We got a journalists attention after getting over **55,000** page views from soft promotion on Reddit. In total, we have **over 2,000** users with over **750 hours of playtime**.

Highlights:
• **Gamified learning experience** with rewards and progression
• **Interactive DSA challenges** with real-time feedback
• **Linux-based execution environment** for authentic development experience
• **Docker containerization** for consistent and secure code execution
• **Zx shell integration** for powerful command-line operations
• **Containerized execution** for safe code running
• **Real-time feedback** system for immediate learning
• **Type-safe APIs** with tRPC for reliable data handling
