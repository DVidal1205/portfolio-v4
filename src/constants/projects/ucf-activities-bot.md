The UCF Activities Bot was a **Discord automation tool** I built my freshman year at UCF after being frustrated with the lack of a centralized way to find events on campus. I wanted to make a bot that would scrape the UCF Events Calendar daily and post upcoming events to multiple Discord servers. Over a month, I learned **web-scraping with Selenium**, how to develop a **Discord bot** with **Nextcord**, and how to deploy a **Raspberry Pi** to keep the bot running 24/7. Scattered among a handful of different servers, these alerts are now a staple for many students to find events on campus.

Highlights:
• **3000+ UCF students** served across various Discord servers
• **Daily event updates** automatically posted every morning
• **Web scraping automation** using Selenium for reliable data collection
• **Raspberry Pi deployment** for 24/7 operation
