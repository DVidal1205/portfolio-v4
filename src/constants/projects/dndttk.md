DNDTTK was made at my very **first** Hackathon, Shell Hacks 2023. The story of its development is actually quite funny. Initially, I had a team of 4 with some people from Knight Hacks - we wanted to build an AR app in Unity (terrible idea). It took us the first 12 of 36 hours just to set up the GitHub repository, so we gave up and did our own things.

I saw a quick **Tkinter** video on **LinkedIn Learning**, and learned all I needed in the remaining 24 hours to make something. While it is not pretty, and no where near optimized, it was a fantastic learning experience (and I actually used it in my D&D games before making Project Wildspace, and Wildspace Web).

Highlights:
• **First GUI application** using Python and Tkinter
• **D&D character generation** with authentic game mechanics
• **Hackathon project** for ShellHacks 2023
• **Underdog project** after wasting 12 hours on Unity...
