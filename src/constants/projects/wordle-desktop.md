Wordle Desktop was my **very first desktop application** built with **Qt** in **C++**. About a year into software development, I was getting annoyed with being confined to the CLI - it felt mundane, and unimpressive. Since I took a few C++ classes, I reached for a C++ native GUI framework, and Qt was the first one I found.

Highlights:
• **First GUI application** using Qt and C++
• **Wordle game clone** with complete game mechanics
• **Qt Creator IDE** for modern C++ development
• **Cross-platform compatibility** through Qt framework
