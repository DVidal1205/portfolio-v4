**Winner of Best use of Google Gemini** at Bitcamp 2025 Hackathon! VisuWorld is a revolutionary approach to **generative 3D scene creation** using Large Language Models and Google Gemini. VisuWorld takes a unique approach to 3D scene generation by using a **GLSL** parsing layer to generate 3D scenes from a **natural language description** - rather than a traditional diffusion based approach. We gathered over **36,000** GLSL samples from online, which were embedded and fed into a **RAG pipeline** to show Gemini core concepts. We also implemented a public gallery to allow users to view other scenes, the prompts that generated them, and use them as a starting point for their own scenes.

This project got the attention of **Google Deepmind** and [Paige Bailey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dynamicwebpaige/), AI Developer Relations Lead. This got our team invited to a **Google Deepmind Develope Showcase**, where we were able to pitch our project to the team and get feedback (and some free swag).

Not only was this project a huge success, but it was also the first travel Hackathon for Knight Hacks. As President, I was able to make history by bringing **25 members** of our club across the east coast to compete in the Hackathon. Our accomplishments were featured in a [UCF Today Article](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/2025/05/16/knight-hacks-wins-multiple-awards-from-bitcamp-xi/) for our grand success. Even though we were only **3%** of the total participants, we won nearly **25%** of the prizes - GO KNIGHT HACKS!

Highlights:
• **Hackathon winner** - Best use of Google Gemini
• **Invited to pitch** to Google Deepmind team
• **Innovative 3D generation** using LLMs and a **GLSL** parsing layer.
• **Real-time scene creation** with natural language input
