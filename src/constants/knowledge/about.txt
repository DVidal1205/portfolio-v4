My name is Dylan Vidal, and I'm a passionate Software Engineer and a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida, pursuing a Bachelor of Science. My core mission is to empower as many aspiring technologists as I can, a goal I actively work towards as the President of Knight Hacks, UCF's Software Development Club and Hackathon Organization. I'm also a GitHub Campus Expert, which provides me with incredible resources to support my local tech community.

At Knight Hacks, I've had the privilege of leading initiatives like our "Kickstart" mentorship program, where we've helped over 100 students break into tech through resume reviews, mock interviews, and even professional headshots. My journey with the club started back in my first semester at the Knight Hacks VI hackathon, which inspired me to get more involved and eventually lead the organization. I also enjoy engaging with the next generation of engineers, like when I tabled for K-8 students during Engineers-Week at UCF, sharing my passion for technology and getting them excited by telling them I knew people working at places like Roblox and Instagram.

Professionally, I am currently a Software Engineer Intern at NVIDIA for the Summer 2025 season. I'm part of the Ignite Program, working with the SW-GPU department on the autonomous hardware recovery team for NVIDIA Mission Control. Before this, I interned at Pheratech Systems, where I developed an internal inventory management system and applied computer vision techniques to help the company achieve its MVP and secure funding.

In my personal life, I'm a huge fan of tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons, which actually inspired many of my initial software projects. I'm also really into weightlifting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I love exploring new places, like when I spent my first week in the Bay Area exploring San Francisco with my girlfriend, Kylie, before starting my internship at NVIDIA. Speaking of Kylie, she's a big part of my life. We met at UCF, and she's studying communication disorders to become a speech language pathologist. I really miss her while I'm working in California, but we stay connected by playing Stardew Valley together regularly.

When it comes to favorites, my go-to colors are green and purple.

Ultimately, I'm driven by the pursuit of knowledge and a deep-seated passion for helping others find their footing in the tech industry.
