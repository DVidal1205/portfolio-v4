DNDTTK was one of my **very first GUI-based projects**, created for ShellHacks 2023. This Dungeons and Dragons themed character generator marked my **transition from CLI to GUI development**.

Project highlights:
• **First GUI application** using Python and Tkinter
• **D&D character generation** with authentic game mechanics
• **Hackathon project** for ShellHacks 2023
• **User-friendly interface** for tabletop gaming enthusiasts

Technical learning:
• **Tkinter GUI framework** for Python desktop applications
• **Event-driven programming** for interactive user interfaces
• **Game mechanics implementation** for D&D character creation
• **User experience design** for intuitive interfaces
