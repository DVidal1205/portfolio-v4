# Workshops

## Full Stack 101 (April 2025)
**Description:** The second workshop in a 2 part series on building web pages and web apps. This workshop goes beyond static pages and introduces functional databases, APIs, and other key concepts via the T3 Stack.
**Concepts Covered:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, tRPC, PostgreSQL, Drizzle, SSR, CSR, Authentication, SEO
**Additional Info:** Just like Web Development 101, this workshop also started as a private workshop for my mentees. The only difference is this workshop went over a TON of refinements and optimizations before ever making it to Knight Hacks, but I am happy with where it ended up.
