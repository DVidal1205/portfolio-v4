Tapestry is an AI-powered life graph that helps you explore your future with predictive and personalized insights using **Google ADK** and **Gemini**. Tapestry guides users through a Google ADK-powered interview, gathering their background, aspirations, and values. From there, a user may also optionally upload an image of themselves to be stored.

From there, the user can begin generating their many life paths via nodes, each representing a core decision or life event. After exploring for long enough, the user can enter any nodes timeline, seeing exactly how they can get to that point in life. Additionally, they can view themselves doing just that, with images generated by **Gemini Nano Banana** and even aging depending on how deep into your life you have simulated. These decisions are made with thoughtful intent about your current state in life, interests, goals, and the previous decisions made prior.

Highlights:
• **Interactive Graph** with **React ForceGraph3D**
• **Google ADK** for interview and personalized node generation
• **Gemini Nano Banana** for image generation
• **PostgreSQL** for user database
• **MinIO** for image object storage
• **NextAuth** for easy Google OAuth
