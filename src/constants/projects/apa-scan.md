I built APA-Scan and AS-Quant for my research position at the [University of Central Florida's Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Lab](http://genome.ucf.edu/cbb/new_look/pages/software.php). Funny enough, I had actually never taken a biology class before this, so I had to learn a lot about the field. While biology isn't exactly my thing, I was able to learn a lot about the field and use **parallelized Python** to speed up their pre-existing tools by a whopping **89%**.

Highlights:
• **Parallelized processing** for handling large genetic datasets
• **Managed data** with Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation
• **Optimized performance** using Cython for computational bottlenecks
• **Integration** with standard bioinformatics tools like Samtools
