Wildspace Web is a continuation of the **Project Wildspace** project, but built as a **SaaS** instead of a desktop application. I wanted to take the ideas from Project Wildspace and expand to a web application with shareability in mind. Distributing a web application was as easy as sending a link, and character data would exist and be shareable across many different clients.

Wildspace Web also included two new big features for world generation - context-aware **image generation**, and context tagging for multi-layered generations. This way, you could generate a new character, while passing in context of someone else to serve as a sibling, rival, or partner. Wildspace Web was also built with **LangChain** to enforce schema parsing (something quite difficult at the time).

Highlights:
• **AI-powered world generation** with customizable parameters
• **Comprehensive worldbuilding tools** for DMs
• **Database-driven content** with Prisma ORM
• **MySQL backend** for reliable data storage
• **Stripe integration** for payment processing
• **Context-aware image generation** with DALL-E 3
• **Context tagging** for multi-layered generations
• **LangChain schema parsing** for better data handling
