Project Wildspace was a continuation off the idea I tested with **DNDTTK** at Shell Hacks 2023. I wanted to take the idea of a **D&D character generator** and expand it to a full **AI-powered worldbuilder**. The last application was not generative - it just randomly selected pre-determined fields. It was also only focused on characters.

We implemented a **desktop application** built with **PySide** and **Qt** that allows users to generate **immersive worlds** for tabletop roleplaying games using **Generative AI**. Built with **LangChain** on top of the **GPT-3.5 API** (a marvel at the time...) We also were able to implement many different types of generations - NPC, Building, Town, Encounters, Groups, and Dungeons from an inputted World File.

Highlights:
• **AI-powered world generation** using LangChain
• **Desktop application** built with PySide and Qt
• **Proof of concept** for AI in tabletop gaming
• **Professional packaging** with Inno Installer
• **Prompt engineering** for better contextualized world generation
