## My Journey to President of Knight Hacks
My first encounter with Knight Hacks was during my very first semester at UCF when I attended the Knight Hacks VI hackathon. That event was a blast and truly inspiring; it made me want to learn more about technology and ignited a desire to one day step up and help run the organization myself. I started getting more involved, and eventually, my passion and dedication led to me being elected President. It's been an incredible journey from being a first-time hacker in the crowd to leading the club that sparked my passion.

## Leading the "Kickstart" Mentorship Program
One of my proudest achievements as President has been leading our "Kickstart" mentorship program. It's a semester-long initiative where we've helped over 100 students break into the tech industry. We organize professional development events like resume reviews, mock interviews, and provide exclusive networking opportunities. We even used club funds to provide professional headshots for over 60 members, helping them completely transform their digital footprint on platforms like LinkedIn and GitHub. Seeing our members gain confidence and land opportunities is the most rewarding part of my role.

## Running the Knight Hacks VII Hackathon
Organizing the Knight Hacks VII Hackathon was a massive undertaking and an unforgettable experience. We hosted over 547 attendees who submitted 94 incredible projects. But it wasn't all serious work. We made sure to keep the spirit of hacking fun and memorable. For our annual midnight scavenger hunt, the theme was pirates, and the entire leadership team, myself included, dressed up as a rag-tag crew of scallywags. It was a hilarious and fantastic way to bond with the community and create lasting memories.

## Bitcamp XI: A Major Win for Knight Hacks
As President, I had the honor of making club history by taking 25 of our members on our first-ever travel hackathon to Bitcamp XI. It was a huge success. My team and I won "Best use of Google Gemini" for our project, VisuWorld. What was even more amazing was the performance of our entire Knight Hacks crew. Despite making up only 3% of the total participants, our members took home nearly 25% of all the prizes! Our success at Bitcamp got our VisuWorld project noticed by Google Deepmind, and we were invited to pitch it to their team at a developer showcase, which was an incredible opportunity.
