CodeJoust was developed by a group of **7** for the University of Central Florida's COP4331C Web Development course. While the requirements for the project weren't necessarily high, we used them as an opportunity to build CodeJoust. We built a **real-time combat game** using **WebSockets** to handle game state, game room management, and online matchmaking.

We were able to setup a custom **Leetcode OAuth** flow, so that users could login with their Leetcode account. This way, problems submitted through CodeJoust would also be recognized on a users Leetcode profile. We also implemented a full **weighted elo system** for matchmaking, so that users would be matched with others of similar skill level.

Highlights:
• **Real-time multiplayer** coding challenges with friends
• **Gamified learning** with points, leaderboards, and achievements
• **LeetCode integration** for comprehensive problem sets
• **WebSocket communication** for live competition updates
• **Elo system** for matchmaking
